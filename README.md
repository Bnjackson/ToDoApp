# ToDoApp
App that allows the user to add, delete and search through a list of to-do's. 

First time using JavaSript DOM manipulation to this extent in a project. I learned how to add new elements, change their node text values, delete them and connect this functionality to HTML and CSS. 

The search bar did not work as intended, it only hides the text not the whole row. In hindsight I should have displayed the items as a list instead of in a form. Once I have more practise with DOM manipulation im going to recreate this project.
